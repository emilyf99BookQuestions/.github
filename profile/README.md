## Introduction
This Organisation is where I am storing any exercises I complete from books as I work through them.
I treat this organisation as a way to track my skill development and show my self learning process.

This is being actively worked on in between projects.

## Currently Working On
- Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, 10th edition
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- Java Programming 9
